The program of phase 3 was implemented my python. The python code is phase3.py
Results folder will automatically created at the location of code.

The results calculated …
- Stationary at the DAY level (each timestamp of each sensor will have its Beta0-50 and sigma)
- Without connection between days
- Without backward-forward effect of the observed variables

The program needs …
- numpy, and csv library
- sklearn for LinearRegression
- matplotlib for plotting graphs
- intelLabDataProcessed dataset folder in the same location as the code
