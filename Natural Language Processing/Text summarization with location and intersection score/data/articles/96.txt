Airliners and anything referencing "detonation devices" don't mix.

A mobile hot spot with the name "Mobile Detonation Device" had some Qantas Airways passengers refusing to fly over the weekend.
A passenger spotted the hot spot on her phone's Wi-Fi menu after she boarded the Qantas flight in Melbourne, according to a report in the Western Australian.
She notified the crew, and the captain delayed the Saturday flight to Perth to locate the device, passenger John Vidler told the media outlet.
"He said there was a device on the plane that had a name on it that he found threatening and that we were not leaving until that device was brought to him," Vidler said.
Not a smooth move.
Although the device wasn't found, the flight was cleared for takeoff -- but not before Vidler and about 40 other passengers opted not to fly.
"There was no security risk to the plane, which landed safely in Perth," a Qantas spokesperson told CNN via email.
"Some passengers elected not to travel so there was a delay as bags were taken off and those passengers disembarked."
The plane landed about two hours late.
