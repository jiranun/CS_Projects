Kenneth Bae spent almost two years performing grueling work for the North Korean regime -- and had another decade of hard labor ahead of him.

But he's no longer shoveling coal and hauling rocks. Instead, the American sat down with CNN's Chris Cuomo on Monday for his first live interview since his 2014 release.
"I'm thankful every day and grateful for so many people that were involved in trying to get me home," Bae said. "It's unreal just to see that I'm actually sitting in the studio talking to you ... 735 days in North Korea was long enough. But I'm thankful."
Bae was the longest-held U.S. citizen detained in North Korea since the Korean War. In 2013, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for committing unspecified "hostile acts" in the country.

"I worked from 8 a.m. to 6 pm. at night, working on the field, carrying rock, shoveling coal," Bae said on CNN's "New Day."
Adding to the physical pain was the verbal abuse he received from North Korean officials, Bae said.
He said one prosecutor repeatedly told him, " 'No one remembers you. You have been forgotten by people, your government. You're not going home anytime soon. You'll be here for 15 years. You'll be 60 before you go home.' "
Still, Bae held out hope.
"I certainly hoped when I was in North Korea ... that some day I'll be able to come home and celebrate with the friends and family that have been praying, rooting for my release," he said.
His wish came true in November 2014 after a top U.S. official -- carrying a letter from President Barack Obama -- arrived in North Korea. Shortly afterward, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered Bae's release.
