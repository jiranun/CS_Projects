A drone apparently slammed into a British Airways plane headed to London on Sunday, officials said. The plane was headed from Geneva, Switzerland, to London's Heathrow Airport when the pilot said he thought a drone had struck the aircraft, London Metropolitan Police said. A drone that carries humans? The Airbus A320 had 132 passengers and five crew members on board, British Airways spokesman Michael Johnson said.

Johnson said engineers thoroughly examined the plane and cleared it for its next flight.

Of those cases, more than one-third involved drones and manned aircraft coming within 500 feet of each other. "Our findings indicate that incidents largely occur in areas where manned air traffic density is high and where drone use is prohibited," experts said in a statement. Drones flying too close to commercial flights pose a serious threat to larger aircraft, and can be sucked into the engine or crash into the cockpit window, injuring or killing a pilot.
