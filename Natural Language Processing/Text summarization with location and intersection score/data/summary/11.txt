A destroyed vehicle lies under debris in Portoviejo on April 17.

Rescue crews searched desperately through rubble Sunday for survivors of a magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck coastal Ecuador.

The hardest-hit area was the coastal Manabi Province, where about 200 people died, said Ricardo Pe√±aherrera of Ecuador's national emergency management office.

The cities of Manta, Portoviejo and Pedernales, a tourist destination, saw the most devastation but damage was widespread throughout the country.

"Last night a violent earthquake hit Ecuador, causing numerous victims and great damages," Francis said.
