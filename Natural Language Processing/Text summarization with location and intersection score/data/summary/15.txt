Philippines presidential hopeful Rodrigo Duterte has refused to apologize after his controversial comments on gang rape.

A YouTube video appeared over the weekend of Duterte joking about the 1989 rape and murder of an Australian missionary that took place in Davao City, in the country's southeast, where he is mayor, CNN Philippines reported.

Phil Robertson, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said on Twitter Duterte's comments were "a disgusting endorsement of sexual violence."

What a waste," he said, according to a CNN Philippines translation of the comments.

His comments drew heated criticism from other hopefuls in the upcoming May 9 presidential election, which one recent poll tipped him to win.
