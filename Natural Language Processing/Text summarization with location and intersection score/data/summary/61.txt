A judge has ordered WhatsApp service be reinstated across Brazil, granting an appeal by the messaging app's parent company, Facebook.

It unclear when the WhatsApp service will be available for users in Brazil.

Last December, a Sao Paulo state judge blocked the service for 48 hours after WhatsApp failed to respond to two court orders "in a criminal investigation."

Facebook has not commented.

A regional judge on Monday ordered all telephone operators in Brazil to block WhatsApp, the popular messaging app, for failing to turn over data as part of an ongoing drug trafficking investigation.
