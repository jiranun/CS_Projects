When a team of less than a dozen U.S. military advisers came under attack in Iraq Tuesday from more than 100 ISIS fighters, Navy SEAL Charles Keating IV was part of the force sent in to rescue them.

Keating, a decorated combat veteran and star athlete who decided to enlist after the 9/11 attacks, did not.

"It didn't surprise me when he said (he) wanted to be a Navy SEAL," Reniewicki told CNN.

His high school track and cross country coach, Robert Wayne Reniewicki, said Keating made the decision to serve his country after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Keating's death is the third American combat loss since the U.S. redeployed forces to Iraq in the summer of 2014 to advise local forces and conduct Special Operations missions against ISIS.
