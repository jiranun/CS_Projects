Earlier this year, director/explorer James Cameron explained that his sequel to the 3D film Avatar, a 2009 blockbuster that grossed nearly $3 billion, would be delayed and not ready for its original target release date of the 2017 winter holidays. But just when all hope seemed lost, this week at CinemaCon, Cameron (he who is memorably also responsible for creating the Connor Family, and "Get away from her, you bitch!") announced that the project is very much still alive. In fact, now the first sequel will arrive at theaters in 2018, followed by three others (in 2020, 2022, and 2023).Despite what you may read on Tumblr, Reddit, and various other pockets of the Internet, though, Cameron's decision wasn't swayed by a hilariously incisive tweet. "Avatar made a ton of money, but came and went. I hope people spread this tweet around and believe it, but it came from nowhere but a Word processor and a screenshot.
