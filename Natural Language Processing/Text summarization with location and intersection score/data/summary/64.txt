The ultracool dwarf star, known as TRAPPIST-1, isn't the kind of star scientists expected to be a hub for planets.

This diagram lines up planets recently discovered by Kepler in terms of their sizes, compared with Earth.

For the first time, researchers have discovered three potentially habitable, Earth-like worlds orbiting an ultracool dwarf star 40 light-years away in another star system, according to a study published in the journal Nature.

Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f are thought capable of hosting life.

The planet was discovered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope.
