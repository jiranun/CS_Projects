Devices designed to work inside the body, like pacemakers or camera capsules, send data back out of the body, so that doctors can monitor a patientâ€™s health. But that signal, which is transmitted via radio waves, is weak and slow, operating at a maximum of 50 kilobytes per second (for reference, the recommended download speed to properly watch Netflix is 1.5 megabits, or about 188 kilobytes). A team of researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign has found a way to increase the bandwidth for these electronic devices--a plan they call MEAT-COMMS. Instead of using radio waves, the researchers created devices that transmit digital data via ultrasound. They found that the maximum transmission speed was about 30 megabits per second, enough bandwidth to watch Netflix in Ultra HD quality.
