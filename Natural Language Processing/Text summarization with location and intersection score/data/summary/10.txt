Queen Elizabeth II could be out of a job.

In fact, the King's House official website notes that his title is "Her Majesty's representative in Jamaica," suggesting that Allen is effectively pushing to push himself out.

In his speech, Allen called for an amendment "to give legalization for marijuana to be used for specific purposes."

In a speech to legislators Thursday, Jamaican Governor-General Patrick Allen proposed a constitutional amendment "to replace Her Majesty The Queen with a Non-Executive President as Head of State" in the Caribbean nation.

While Elizabeth II isn't involved much at all in the day-to-day functioning of Jamaica's government, she's officially head of state in 15 nations in what's called the Commonwealth, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
