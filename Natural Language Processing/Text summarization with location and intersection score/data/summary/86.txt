A helicopter carrying workers from an oil platform to the mainland crashed off the coast of Hordaland, Norway, on Friday, most likely killing 13 people, according to police.

Two people were still missing when rescue operations stopped Friday afternoon.

This was "one of the most severe helicopter accidents in the history of the Norwegian oil industry," said Statoil's Arne Sigve Nylund, executive vice president development and production Norway.

The helicopter carried two pilots and 11 passengers and was flying from an oil platform in the North Sea to the city of Bergen.

Hordaland is about 250 miles west of Oslo, the Norwegian capital.
