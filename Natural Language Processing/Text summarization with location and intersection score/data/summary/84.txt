That led some to advance theories that Mercedes, a German team, were "sabotaging" Hamilton's efforts so German driver Rosberg could win the drivers' title.

Wolff responded angrily as allegations swirled on social media after the Russian Grand Prix, which was won by Hamilton's Mercedes colleague Nico Rosberg.

Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has hit out at the "bunch of lunatics" putting forward "conspiracy theories" that the team is sabotaging Lewis Hamilton's chances this season.

Although Hamilton -- who has endured a frustrating campaign -- came second to Rosberg in Sochi, his race was affected by an engine problem.

The engine failure Hamilton suffered in qualifying left him 10th on the grid and followed a similar problem in China, when he was left at the back of the grid and finished seventh.
