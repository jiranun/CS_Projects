It was peacetime when the USS Conestoga departed from California's Golden Gate strait on March 25, 1921, but in one of the biggest maritime mysteries the vessel disappeared without a trace.

The Conestoga departed Golden Gate en route to American Samoa via Pearl Harbor, but never arrived in Hawaii.

On Wednesday -- nearly 95 years after the Navy declared the Conestoga and its crew lost -- the shipwreck's discovery was officially announced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Navy.

The Navy seagoing tugboat and its 56 officers and crew went missing so long ago that the famous bridge that spans the Golden Gate did not yet exist.
