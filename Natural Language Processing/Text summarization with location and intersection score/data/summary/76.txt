The host city for the 2016 Summer Olympics was hit with a setback Thursday when a large portion of a multimillion-dollar seaside bike path collapsed, killing two people and injuring three others.

Rio 2016: Neighborhood demolished to clear path for the Olympics Rio neighborhood demolished ahead of Olympics Carvalho said the city was contacting the engineers who designed the path to "check and revise" the project, which is scheduled to be extended to the Barra neighborhood in southern Rio.

The deaths came hours after the Olympic torch was lit in Greece as a prelude to the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.

Cyclist Eric Poseidon posted a video on Facebook, describing the scene and showing the path moments after it collapsed as well as what appeared to be one of the victims.

The $12 million bike path, which Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes inaugurated in January, was part of the city's major renovation projects before the 2016 Games, which begin in August.
