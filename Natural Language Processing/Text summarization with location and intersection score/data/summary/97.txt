A video purporting to show Western and Filipino hostages of the ISIS-aligned militant group Abu Sayyaf emerged this week, with the three captives pleading to governments, friends, politicians and even celebrities to come to their aid.

The video, obtained by extremist monitoring organization SITE, shows Norwegian national Kjartan Sekkingstad, Canadian national Robert Hall and Filipina Marites Flor sitting on the ground, surrounded by six armed militants, one of whose faces is masked.

The group had earlier demanded a Php 300 million ransom ($6.37 million) for each of the victims to be paid by April 25, Philippines state media reported.

The violent extremist group seeks to establish an independent Islamic state on Mindanao, the southernmost major island of the predominantly Catholic Philippines.

Operations against Abu Sayyaf were stepped up in the wake of Ridsdel's murder.
