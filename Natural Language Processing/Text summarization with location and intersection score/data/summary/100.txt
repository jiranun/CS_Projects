Although Ferdinand Marcos' decades-long rule was tainted by widespread corruption and violence, the most recent survey shows his only son, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., as the favorite to become the Philippines' next vice president.

Bongbong, as he is nicknamed, is one of Ferdinand's three children.

It's been 30 years since a Marcos has been at the highest echelons of the Filipino government.

Rise to power Bongbong first entered politics as vice-governor of Ilocos Norte province in 1981 at the age of 23.

Bongbong announced his bid for the vice presidency last October with his family, including mother Imelda, by his side.
