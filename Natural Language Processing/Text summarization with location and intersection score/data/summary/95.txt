A clip of eight New Zealand officers dusting off their best '90s dance moves in front of a police car has been viewed more than 5 million times since it was posted Tuesday on the force's Facebook page.

Police in New Zealand have sparked an international dance-off between law enforcement officers after their response to a "running man" dance challenge went viral.

Bet you can't do that in jandals," read a post on its Facebook page, using a New Zealand expression for flip-flops.

"We catch people on the run every day, this was a new #runningmanchallenge for our team," read the post on the New Zealand Police Recruitment account.

The officers throw down the gauntlet to other police around the world.
