The disguise was meant to throw off an alarm activated by body heat.

Two would-be robbers left a shiny impression on police in southern Brazil, when they chose an unusual form of camouflage during an attempted bank robbery: head-to-toe aluminum foil.

At least one person was arrested over the weekend in connection with the attempted robbery.

According to Santa Catarina military police, the suspects were most likely trying to foil the alarm of the Praia Grande branch of the Banco do Brasil late Saturday when they chose the metal outfits.

"They broke down one of the walls and thought the detectors from the alarm would not notice them," Santa Catarina military police spokesman Maj. Cristian Dimitri told CNN.
