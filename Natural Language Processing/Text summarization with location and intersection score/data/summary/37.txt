The world is becoming more nearsighted than ever—50 percent of the people on the planet are expected to be nearsighted by 2050. Scientists have long known that a person’s environment is a big factor in whether or not someone becomes myopic (nearsighted), and many believed that more time spent looking at screens was a large cause for the increase.But new research shows that exposure to outdoor light might play a bigger role in preventing myopia than previously thought. Kids usually stare at screens indoors, which means that their eyes are getting less outdoor light. But screen time isn’t the direct cause, the researchers note.
