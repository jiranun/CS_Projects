A mobile hot spot with the name "Mobile Detonation Device" had some Qantas Airways passengers refusing to fly over the weekend.

Airliners and anything referencing "detonation devices" don't mix.

A passenger spotted the hot spot on her phone's Wi-Fi menu after she boarded the Qantas flight in Melbourne, according to a report in the Western Australian.

She notified the crew, and the captain delayed the Saturday flight to Perth to locate the device, passenger John Vidler told the media outlet.

"There was no security risk to the plane, which landed safely in Perth," a Qantas spokesperson told CNN via email.
