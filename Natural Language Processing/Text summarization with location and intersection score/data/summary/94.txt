More than 1,300 pounds (590kg) of bronze Roman coins dating to the 3rd century A.D. have been unearthed by construction workers digging a trench in Spain.

"The workers immediately stopped, and soon discovered that there were many coins there, inside broken amphoras."

The coins were found in 19 amphoras, a type of Roman jug, in Tomares, a town in Seville province.

Lola Vallejo, Tomares urban councillor, told CNN-affiliate Atlas that a crew had been digging a ditch to install electricity to a park when they came across the incredible find.

The initial hypothesis is that the coins were to be used to pay taxes to the Roman empire, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais.
