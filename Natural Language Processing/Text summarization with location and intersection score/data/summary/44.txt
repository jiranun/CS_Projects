eBay may turn household junk into online treasure, but archaeologists held their breaths in horrified anticipation when the site first launched over a decade ago thinking that the illegal artifacts market would surely explode in a frenzy of looting.The resulting flood of copies has actually increased risks of buying genuine artifacts and lowered overall prices, further discouraging the casual looter. "Chinese, Bulgarian, Egyptian, Peruvian and Mexican workshops are now producing fakes at a frenetic pace," Stanish wrote in a paper that's detailed in the May/June issue of Archaeology. First, fakes have become so technologically sophisticated that authentication has become a minefield, even for experts.Second, authentication technology will eventually catch up, just as it has helped protect real currency and identify art forgeries.
