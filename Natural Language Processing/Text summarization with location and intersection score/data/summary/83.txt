Underdog Leicester City won the English Premier League title for the first time Monday -- without kicking a ball -- as closest rival Tottenham failed to beat Chelsea.

Leicester's 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Sunday had meant Tottenham needed to win its remaining three games to have any chance of a first league title since 1961.

The match ended 2-2, giving Leicester City its first Premier League title in club history.
