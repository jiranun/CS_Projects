The family of a young Afghan boy, who gained worldwide fame after being photographed wearing a makeshift Lionel Messi soccer jersey fashioned from a plastic bag, has fled to Pakistan after receiving threats, the father of the boy told CNN.

The family is now living in Quetta and has submitted an application with the United Nations seeking asylum in Pakistan.

"I love Messi and want to meet Messi," the boy said.

"I received 20-30 unknown threatening calls in Afghanistan asking why I'm teaching my kid about football and not teaching him about the Quran," the boy's father, Muhammad Arif Ahmadi, told CNN.

That's when I decided to come to Pakistan," Ahmadi said.
