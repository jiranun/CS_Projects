Today, nearly 40 percent of the US population has myopia, or nearsightedness, and it’s only expected to grow. By 2050, 50 percent of the world’s population, a total of nearly 5 billion, will be myopic, according to a new review study published yesterday in the journal Opthalmology. Much of the increase, the researchers suspect, is due to environmental factors, “principally lifestyle changes resulting from a combination of decreased time outdoors and increased near work activities. Based on that information, the researchers expect that the number of people with myopia in 2050 will be double what it was in 2000; high myopia, a more severe form of the condition, will have quintupled in the same timeframe, possibly due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. But the researchers conclude that government, education, and healthcare systems have to work together to change the environmental factors that cause myopia in the first place.
