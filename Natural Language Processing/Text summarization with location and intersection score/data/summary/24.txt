Chances are, anyone visiting the Andaman coast will ride one of these distinctive craft.

Today there's hardly a postcard of southern Thailand's Andaman coast that doesn't feature a long-tail boat -- or "rua hang yao" in Thai.

With their narrow profile and negligible draft, long-tail boats are ideal for navigating the shallow bays, creeks, caves and passageways of Krabi's picturesque marine environment.

They're seen either moored on some idyllic beach of powdery sand, or powering through the turquoise sea with a foaming arc of water thrown up behind.

Yet the majority work in and around the resorts of Krabi and Phuket on the Andaman coast, where they play a major role in ferrying tourists and supplies, as well as carrying local fishermen to their daily fishing grounds.
