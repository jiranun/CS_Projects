It's going to get noisy in parts of the Northeast when hordes of cicadas emerge after spending 17 years under ground.

Billions of the critters will make themselves heard in Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia once the soil where they live warms up to 64 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the website Cicadamania.com.

Ohio State University professor Dave Shetlar, who's known as "The BugDoc," told CNN affiliate WBNS that could happen in April in southern Ohio, but most of the state will see the cicadas in May.

Cleveland Metroparks posted a picture on Instagram earlier this month of a young cicada waiting to make its debut.
