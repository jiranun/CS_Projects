Walking fish poses threat to land animals.

Not content with telling Jonny Depp's dogs to "bugger off," Australia's new Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has moved onto his next target ... carp.

In an AUD$15 million ($11.4 million) plan to wipe the species out, the federal government announced that it will potentially release cyprinid herpesvirus (carp herpesvirus) into Australian waterways in 2018.
