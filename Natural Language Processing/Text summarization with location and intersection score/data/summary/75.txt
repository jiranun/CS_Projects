Havana Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Ortega y Alamino, a key figure in the secret negotiations that led to the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, stepped down Tuesday as the Catholic Church's top official on the communist-run island, a Vatican statement said.

"I will live more quietly," Ortega told CNN in 2015 on his plans for life after stepping down.

The statement did not name Ortega's replacement as cardinal of the Cuban church.

"The desire that Raul Castro expressed to the United States: to live together with differences but in a civil way is also what the Cuban Church has expressed to the Cuban government," Ortega told CNN.

Obama was the first U.S. president to visit Cuba in nearly 90 years.
