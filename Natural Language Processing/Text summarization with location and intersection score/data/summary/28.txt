This matters especially when, say, employees of Facebook ask if their CEO can use the company to stop a presidential candidate from winning the office. From Gizmodo: Every week, Facebook employees vote in an internal poll on what they want to ask Zuckerberg in an upcoming Q&A session. A question from the March 4 poll was: â€œWhat responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017? In an election, would Facebook bring that same ability to bear against a particular candidate, particularly an abhorrent one? The company says "no" for now, but it's one of the many questions that won't be settled by this election.
