Climate change is a big, broad, crazy topic that often seems far removed from our daily lives. And it's not like we can physically see the rising level of carbon dioxide in our air. It's literally invisible. And unfortunately, the people most likely to be affected by climate change are people that are already the most vulnerable. There are other options, including increasing awareness of the effects of climate change through educational programs, working to reduce the causes of climate change (fossil fuels, etc), and starting to prepare for some of these things in the present, instead of waiting for this future to appear on our doorstep.
