A drone apparently slammed into a British Airways plane headed to London on Sunday, officials said.

The Airbus A320 had 132 passengers and five crew members on board, British Airways spokesman Michael Johnson said.

The plane was headed from Geneva, Switzerland, to London's Heathrow Airport when the pilot said he thought a drone had struck the aircraft, London Metropolitan Police said.

Of those cases, more than one-third involved drones and manned aircraft coming within 500 feet of each other.

Hundreds of drones have flown dangerously close to manned aircraft in U.S. airspace, forcing pilots to sometimes take evasive action, according to a study released in December.
