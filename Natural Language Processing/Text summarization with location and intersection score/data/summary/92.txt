Has it really been five years since Prince William and Kate Middleton tied the knot?

These days their first child Prince George, 2, makes his own headlines by shaking hands with U.S. President Barack Obama, while wearing an adorable dressing gown which quickly flew off the shelves, while their second child Princess Charlotte, who will celebrate her first birthday next week, continues to grow up before our eyes.

A huge crowd cheered as the royal couple shared a kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, following the service -- one of the most memorable images from the day.

Since marrying in a star-studded ceremony at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, the royal couple has attended the Olympic Games, had two children, celebrated the Queen's 90th birthday, and attended dozens of official events across the globe.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding was watched by millions across the world, with Kate choosing to omit the word "obey" from her vows -- much like William's mother Princess Diana did when she married Prince Charles in 1981.
