Apple and World Wildlife Fund announced their new Earth Day initiative of environmentally themed apps.Today Apple announced the arrival of a new green-initiative known as “Apps For Earth” to coincide with Earth Day next week. The project aims to spread environmental consciousness through its millions of customers by injecting environmental themes and motifs into 27 of its most popular apps. The tech giant plans to run “ Apps For Earth,” in partnership with the World Wildlife Fund, for ten days, starting today and ending April 24. Earth Day is Friday April 22. It’s fitting and frankly long overdue for Apple—which has rolled out a number of other high profile green initiatives of late—to put such effort into environmentally conscious practices being as they are, part of an inherently non-green business.
