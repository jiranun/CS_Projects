Everyone has Googled themselves at least once. But have you ever wondered what other personal information could be floating around online that Google doesn’t know about?Instant Checkmate aggregates hundreds of millions of publicly available criminal, traffic, arrest, and personal records and posts them online so they can easily be searched by anyone. Previously, if you wanted to research someone’s arrest records, you might have had to actually go in to a county court office—in the appropriate county—and formally request information on an individual. One of the most interesting aspects of Instant Checkmate is that it shows not only criminal records, but also more general background information like court records, various types of licenses (FAA, DEA), previous addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, estimated income levels and even satellite imagery of known addresses.
