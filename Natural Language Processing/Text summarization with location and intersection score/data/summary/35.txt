The binturong, or bearcat, is a member of the civet family that lives in the jungles of Southeast Asia. A bearcat is not actually a cat, nor a bear, but a shy creature of the civet family. With sharp claws, it slowly but purposefully climbs through trees, splitting its time between napping and searching for snacks of rodents, small birds, and fruit. After identifying the different chemical compounds in the bearcatsâ€™ urine, they pinpointed the buttered-popcorn scent culprit as 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, or 2-AP. In popcorn, 2-AP is created when heat jumpstarts Maillard reactions between the sugars and amino acids in the corn kernels.
