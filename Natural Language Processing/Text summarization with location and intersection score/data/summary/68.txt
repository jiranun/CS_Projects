The famed fashion house Chanel turned a crumbling colonial boulevard in Havana into a brightly-lit runway Tuesday, throwing one of the swankiest and star-studded parties the island has seen since Fidel Castro took power in 1959.

Guests were whisked to the show by dozens of multi-colored 1950's American cars rented for the evening.

Actress and model Tilda Swinton, actor Vin Diesel and supermodel Gisele Bundchen joined members of the Castro family to view the Resort 2017 collection, which saw the brand take over Paseo del Prado, one of the city's central streets that was closed down for the event.
