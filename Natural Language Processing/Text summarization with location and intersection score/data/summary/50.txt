Diets rich in vegetable oils and low in saturated fat might not be all they are cracked up to be in terms of heart health, according to new research. What was surprising was that lower cholesterol was actually associated with an increased risk of dying during the study period, and this was true for both the saturated fat and unsaturated fat diet groups. There could be several reasons why the unsaturated fat diet in the study might not really be responsible for the increased risk of death, including the cholesterol paradox, according to Sonya Angelone, owner of a nutrition consulting firm in the San Francisco Bay Area and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Angelone recommends people reduce saturated fats in their diet and also try to replace them with omega-3 unsaturated fats.
