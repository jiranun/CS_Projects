But now, the social media giant is continuing its push on the hardware side of its plan, by announcing two new products called Terragraph and Project Aries. These are two different technologies that serve the similar goal of providing internet access; Terragraph uses extremely high radio frequencies, while ARIES focuses on using networks more efficiently to support more devices.Provides high-power networks over short distances. Facebook has built a test platform with 96 antennae, that it claims operates 10 times more efficient than traditional networks, which means more people are able to be served data, and faster. Facebook will be contributing the Terragraph designs to its own Telecom Infra Project, their initiative to upgrade telecommunications infrastructure.
