Now that drones have become a standard tool in our military arsenal, the next job is to make them more efficient and capable than ever before. DARPA's newest invention is the Gremlin: a drone that be deployed from a bomber while in flight, execute its mission, and then return to an extraction point where a cargo plane yanks it out of the sky and brings it safely home. Gremlin drones have up to three hours to accomplish reconnaissance missions, at which time they automatically fly back to a retrieval area to be collected by a C-130 cargo plane.Each Gremlin will be equipped with cameras, sensors, and other electronic capabilities that could be customized to any specific mission. Rounds of development and evaluation will weed out the competition until DARPA officials choose the final Germlin winner by 2020.
