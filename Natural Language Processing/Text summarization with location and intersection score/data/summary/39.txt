Last night, Motor Trend magazine tweeted this from its official account: "Check back tomorrow to see if we found the #AppleCar," along with a severely-cropped image of a gold-colored vehicle with a silver hubcab, the latter emblazoned with Apple's recent logo. As it turns out, the magazine did not find the Apple Car. Instead, Motor Trend drafted faculty and students from the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, known for its influence on auto design, to create entirely speculative renderings of what an Apple Car might look like. But take a look at these renderings and tell me with a straight face Apple would ever release something that looks as unsexy as this. The author of the cover piece, Kim Reynolds, points out in a video above that the speculative car's shape was informed more by the experience that Apple might want passengers to have while riding in it, but that still doesn't really excuse how unappealing this thing looks.
