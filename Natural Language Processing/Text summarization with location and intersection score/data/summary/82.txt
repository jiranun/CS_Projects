Radiohead's "disappearance" from the Internet has proved short-lived, with the band pleasing fans by releasing a new song in a video on YouTube.

The stop-motion video from director Chris Hopewell is for a song called "Burn The Witch."

Yorke released his "Tomorrow's Modern Boxes" solo project independently through a BitTorrent bundle in 2014.

The acclaimed five-piece from Oxford, England, caused a stir in recent days by quietly erasing its Internet presence, fueling speculation that the release of the group's ninth studio album was imminent.

tweeted Niall Doherty, reviews editor at music magazine Q. Radiohead released its last studio album, "King of Limbs," five years ago.
