Scientists have been exploring similarities between birds and dinosaurs, and new research shows that these two types of animals are directly linked. The connections between birds and dinosaurs are explored in a new museum exhibit called Dinosaurs Among Us at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. The exhibit includes ancient fossils and lifelike models of dinosaurs of all sizes to show the evolution of dinosaurs into birds.  It examines several features that are shared between the two species, including feathers, complex brains, the shapes and sizes of eggs, and the ability to fly. Norell noted that the research behind this exhibit is the result of advanced scientific techniques and new technologies.
