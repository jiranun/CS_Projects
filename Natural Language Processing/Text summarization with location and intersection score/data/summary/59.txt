Randy Hentzel's and Harold Nichols' mission in Jamaica was to help the impoverished, building houses and providing medical care for those in need.

"It's something no one would have thought would have happened," Jamaica Constabulary Force spokeswoman Dahlia Garrick said.

The next day, searchers discovered Nichols' body about 500 meters (550 yards) away from Hentzel's remains, Garrick said.

Hentzel's body was found Saturday in bushes north of Kingston, Jamaican authorities said.

Now the police are scrambling for clues in the deaths that Prime Minister Andrew Holness says has the entire nation grieving.
