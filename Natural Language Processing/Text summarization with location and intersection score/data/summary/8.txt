The Pope invited three Syrian migrant families to go with him as he returned home, the Holy See Press Office said.

Pope Francis spoke of empathy and mercy as he met Saturday with migrants on the Greek island of Lesbos.

Then to demonstrate his message, he took 12 of them to the Vatican with him aboard the papal plane.

Francis made a well-publicized visit to the island, home to migrants and refugees who have fled war and violence in the Middle East and North Africa.

In explaining his prayers for the refugees and migrants, Francis invoked the name of the Lord.
