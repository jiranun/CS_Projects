While Project Loon found an initial home in Sri Lanka, Facebook has its own update for its plan to provide wireless internet from the skies. Mark Zuckerberg announced the completion of Aquila, Facebook’s first full-scale aircraft designed to deliver wireless internet with lasers, as a part of their project with Internetorg. Aquila is solar-powered, weighs “less than a car,” and has the wingspan of a Boeing 737, according to the Facebook post. Facebook has teased the technology they’re using to send the signal, long-range lasers, but today Zuckerberg gave some solid statistics. Aquila will be able to send data at 10 gigabits per second at a distance of more than 10 miles.
