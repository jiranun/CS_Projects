The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child affirms the childâ€™s right, in normal circumstances, to enjoy an ongoing relationship with both parents. There is evidence that children who experience the absence of a parent after separation and divorce suffer from a range of social disadvantages. On a more positive note, it is also clear that most separated couples have the interests of their children at heart and want to arrive at good workable parenting arrangements. In summary, the fact that children who spend considerably more time in the care of one of their parents appear to be functioning just well as children whose care time arrangements are more evenly spread between both parents, suggests that time may not be the most important factor when it comes to their wellbeing.If the parenting arrangements themselves are a cause of ongoing tension, the situation should be reviewed. The primary aim of these services is to help the parent change behaviours that would impact negatively on the child or on other members of the family.
