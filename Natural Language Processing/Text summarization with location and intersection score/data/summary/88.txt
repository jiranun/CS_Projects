CERN's Large Hadron Collider, the world's biggest particle accelerator located near Geneva, Switzerland, lost power Friday.

The largest scientific experiment has gone offline because of a foreign intruder.

Unlike the weasel, the bird survived.

The toasty loaf caused a short circuit, sidelining work at the facility for a short time.

The unexpected power loss has shut down the Large Hadron Collider for at least a week as engineers work to make repairs and address other issues, Marsollier said.
