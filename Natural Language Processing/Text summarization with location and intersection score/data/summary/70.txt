Puerto Ricans are leaving the island for the mainland United States at a historic rate.

About 84,000 people moved from Puerto Rico to the United States in 2014, according to the report, while only 20,000 moved back to the island, resulting in a net migration of 1.8%.

The commonwealth's Institute of Statistics revealed Sunday the results of its analysis on 2014 migration, which found that Puerto Rico lost almost 2% of its population that year.

More Puerto Ricans now live in the mainland United States than on the island itself, which eases the transition of Puerto Ricans who move.

Puerto Rico, now 10 years into a recession, is deep in debt and often compared to Greece and Detroit.
